# ZServer TODO - Remaining Issues and Improvements

## ⚠️ Critical Compilation Issues (UPDATED 2025-09-27)

**Status**: **COMPILATION FAILED** - Critical workspace dependency issues identified

### ❌ Primary Compilation Blocker
1. **Missing Workspace Dependencies**:
   - `axum` dependency not defined in workspace `Cargo.toml`
   - Error: `failed to parse manifest at '/home/zach/github/ZDB/crates/zserver/Cargo.toml'`
   - Error: `error inheriting 'axum' from workspace root manifest's 'workspace.dependencies.axum'`
   - Error: `'dependency.axum' was not found in 'workspace.dependencies'`

### 🔍 Secondary Issues Identified
2. **Storage Backend Inconsistency**:
   - Documentation claims zcore-storage uses "redb" but actually uses "fjall"
   - Mixed references to both storage backends throughout codebase
   - Need to update all documentation to reflect fjall LSM-tree implementation

3. **Missing Crate Members**:
   - Several crates referenced in zserver dependencies not in workspace members
   - May cause additional compilation issues after axum is fixed

## 🚨 Immediate Action Required

### Fix Order (Critical Path)
1. **Add axum to workspace dependencies** (BLOCKER):
   ```toml
   # In workspace Cargo.toml
   axum = { version = "0.7", features = ["json", "tokio", "http1", "ws"] }
   ```

2. **Verify all referenced crates exist**:
   - Check workspace members list
   - Remove or add missing crates as needed

3. **Update storage backend documentation**:
   - Change all redb references to fjall
   - Update README.md and other documentation

### After Critical Fixes
Once compilation works, previous analysis shows:
- ✅ **Clean zserver codebase** with good structure
- ✅ **Comprehensive feature set** including WebRTC, transactions, security
- ✅ **Well-organized HTTP server** with proper error handling
- 🔄 **Storage backend documentation** needs updating to reflect fjall usage
